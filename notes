                                    FLEX BOX NOTES:

JUSTIFY CONTENT NOTES:
<justify content> : moves content horizontally.
<flex start> : same as not doing anything, the default.
<flex end> : moves the content to the opposite side on the horizontal plain.
<space between> : put space between the content.
<space around> : evenly spaces the content between the content and the border.
<space evenly> : does both.
<flex direction> : arranges content in either column format or row format.


<flex basis> : used without needing to put "diplay: flex;" first. say you have three boxes
               with one being flex-basis: 400px; another one being flex-basis: 200px; and the 
               last being flex-basis: 100px;. if you shrink the screen they wont always stay 
               at that pixel count but will keep the same ratio. So, box one will always be 4x 
               the size of box three and 2x the size of box two.

<flex grow> : similar to "flex-basis"  but instead doesn't work with pixels. As you stretch the 
              screen the flex boxes will grow. using the same boxes as above. Box one having the 
              value of 4 will grow 4x faster than box three with the value of 1 and twice as fast 
              as box two with the value of 2.

<flex shrink> : works the same as "flex-grow" but goes in the opposite direction. Only difference is 
                that it needs a baseline to work with. You can use "flex-basis" with it.
